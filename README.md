Whether you're looking to attend a party, explore club options, or purchase tickets for exclusive events, NightMi offers a seamless and user-friendly solution tailored to meet your needs.

## Problem Statement
In the nightlife industry, finding and comparing options for events at clubs and nightclubs can be a challenging experience. Many users struggle to access essential information such as:
- Entry prices

- Event-specific details

This challenge becomes even greater for visitors or tourists unfamiliar with a city, as they often lack reliable information about the local nightlife scene. Without a clear and centralized platform, these individuals may face difficulties finding reputable venues or comparing their options effectively. The absence of accessible, consistent data leaves users relying on fragmented sources and incomplete information, leading to less informed decisions.
